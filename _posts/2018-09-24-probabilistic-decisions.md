In a previous post, we enumerated the four necessary constituents for deciding anything: measurements, an action space, a decision rule, and a loss function.  Many great things have come from this stylized setting, including essentially everything in the fields of "pattern recognition" and "data mining". One can often obtain stronger theoretical results, and






<!-- 3. **Estimator** (or **learner**):  Something, or someone, must take as input the measurements, and output an action.  A human can do this, or a mechanical devise, or some combination of the two, e.g., a human operating a computer.  Note, however, that mechanical devises, on their own (at least for now), cannot estimate/learn without human intervention. -->
