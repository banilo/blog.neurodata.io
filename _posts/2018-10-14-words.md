Here is a list of tips I check whenever I write anything:


1. check for any misspelled words using spellcheck
2. replace contractions with complete words (eg, don't --> do not)
3. replace abbreviations with complete words (eg, "e.g." --> for example) 
4. replace colloquialisms with more formal words (eg, nowadays --> recently)
5. i, we, our, us, you, your --> rewrite sentence (almost always)
6. in order to/for --> to/for
7. clearly, obviously --> remove, might not be so clear/obvious to everyone
8. this, they, it --> be specific, which noun this/they/it is referring to is often vague
9. very --> use a stronger adjective/adverb
10. data is --> data are
11. novel --> remove,  novelty should be implied by context. If it is not clear by context, update context
12. most/least/best/worst/better/worse/optimal/*est: requires a citation as it is an empirical claim, or evidence, and a dimension along which the comparison is made
13. usually/typically --> same deal, either provide a citation/evidence, or don't say it, replace with "frequently"
14. no reason / essential/necessary / no way / impossible --> remove, these are all too strong, just because you haven't thought of a reason, or a counter example, or another way, does not mean that nobody else has/can.
15. done --> completed.
16. utilized --> used
17. firstly --> first, and similarly for second, third, etc.
18. & --> and
19. arguably --> possibly, likely, perhaps (why argue with your reader?)
20. as such --> ok sparsely, but often overused, check and revise sentences.
21. numbers have space before unit, eg 1GB --> 1 GB.
22. first --> somebody reading this will think they did it first, and they are at least partially correct. firstness should be implied by context.
23. in this manuscript --> nothing, it is implied.
24. a priori --> should be italics
25. is used --> rewrite sentence, avoid passive tense whenever possible
26. can be seen / it has been shown --> typically just remove, sometimes replace with "shows", or reword sentences
27. we want to --> we (though should be reworded to avoid "we" entirely)
28. Fig, Fig., fig --> Figure (or at least be consistent)
29. we chose appropriate --> we chose (let them decide whether it was appropriate)
30. "note that" or "we note that" or "we highlight" or "we highlight that" --> simply remove.
31. can be / we think / could be / might be / etc.  --> these are always true, and therefore the clause that follows could be anything, and is too weak.  be stronger, but only quantitatively if there is evidence, and cite it.
