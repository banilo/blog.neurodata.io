I write many grants, most of them, or at least the parts that I write, are very quantitative in nature.  Most of how I think about writing them comes directly from discussions with [Brett Mensh](http://optimizescience.com), he is the world's expert on these things, and I highly recommend you contact him.  


### Specific Aims 

This is one page, and it matters more than everything else combined. I do it as follows:

1.  A paragraph introducing the problem we are solving
2.  A paragraph on why it is hard, ie, why other really smart people (e.g., the review panel) have not yet been able to solve it.
3.  A paragraph motivating our overall approach/philosophy to the problem
4.  The 3-4 aims. For each aim, there is a 1-2 line *action* statement of what the aim is, and what it will deliver.  For example, "Develop nonparametric machine learning techniques to identify brain-imaging biomarkers for depression using the Healthy Brain Network Dataset."  Note that there is a verb (develop), and it is clear to the funders what they'll get (a new biomarker for depression), and how we will do it (nonparametric machine learning). 


### Research Strategy

1. Significance: Up to 1-2 pages, talking about how important your problem is to solve, funneling down from most general to most specific.  One sentence in **bold** to highlight the potential impact of your proposed work.

2. Innovation: Up to 0.5 pages, highlighting the novel technical contributions, again, with 1 sentence in **bold** to focus on the key innovation of the proposed work.

3. Approach: ~9-12 pages (depending on the specific grant), organized into an "overview" section followed by 3-4 aims.  The 2-3 page overview section describes commonalities between the aims, any data that are being used, and related things. The overview can also include or be followed by a "general background" that applies to each of the aims. Each aim is about 2-3 pages, and includes the following sections:
    1. *Introduction*: a 1 paragraph jargon free introduction of what you will accomplish in this aim, and how.  
    2. *Justification and Feasibility* or *Preliminary Results*: Up to 1 page describing why you are particularly well suited to accomplish the goals in the allotted time given the allotted resources. 
    3. *Research Design*: ~2 paragraphs on the details of what you'll actually do.
    4. *Expected Outcomes*: 1 paragraph on what you expect to actually "deliver" back to the funding agency.
    5. *Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies*: A few lines to indicate that you understand which parts are difficult, and have a contingency plan.

4. Timeline and Future Direction: ~1/2 page, describing when the activities will happen, including a table organized by Aim, and connecting the work to your future long-term agenda. 


### Some other tips:


1. Follow my blog post on [words]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-04-words %})
2. Follow my blog post on [paragraph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-04-paragraphs %})
3. Follow my blog post on [figures]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-08-figures %})
4. The "name" of each aim/task should be an ["action title"](http://www.quickslide-powerpoint.com/en/blog/action-titles-providing-orientation-well-thought-out-slide-titles)
1. Each aim/task should follow OCAR
1. For each sub-aim/task, include a **bold** sentence precisely and concisely stating its objective (the *action* part)
2. Make sure to distinguish your own work from others explicitly every time your work is cited
3. Check that formatting is consistent across *all* documents (both within type, eg biosketches) and across.
4. Use [google docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
5. Use [paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) for references (free version for 2 weeks)
6. Use [auto-latex](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-latex-equations/iaainhiejkciadlhlodaajgbffkebdog?hl=en-US) for equations
7. Keep figures at very end until last opportunity


#### NSF specific

1. For summary, focus on gap and impact
2. For intellectual merit, use as much language from [NSF Big Ideas](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/documents/Big%20Ideas%20compiled.pdf) as possible
3. Broader impacts is about societal, not intellectual benefit, focusing on STEM education, minorities, disabilities, open source, etc.
