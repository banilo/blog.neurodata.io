This is our first post!  We will be posting periodically, hopefully more frequently than weekly, with various posts about brain science, statistical machine learning and pattern recognition, big data, and miscellaneous stuff that we feel like posting.  The title of this blog, "bits and brains", is based on a dialog with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org/), [Allie Fletcher](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~akfletcher/), [Jascha Sohl-Dickstein](http://www.sohldickstein.com/), [Eva Dyer](http://dyerlab.gatech.edu/), and [Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com/) while we were planning a NIPS Workshop in 2016 called [Brains and Bits: Neuroscience meets Machine Learning](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6247). 


So, stay tuned....
