Upon believing that you have completed work sufficient to write a peer reviewed manuscript, follow the below steps in order. If you are simply writing an abstract, stop after step 2.

1. Write a one sentence summary of your work (will become your **title**;  ~5 min). This sentences describes the main take home message / main result.  It should not have any words that most of your readership will not be familiar with.  It should be attention grabby, it should have less than 88 characters.

2. Describe the "killer fig" that makes the point as clearly and concisely as possible.  Guidance for making paper quality figures is [here](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html).  (~5 min)

3. Describe the other results, typically 3-5 additional figures or theorems.  The goal of each of these is to support the main claim, for example, by further refining, adding controls, etc.  Ideally, they are sequenced together in a logical chain, like a proof, each building on the next, to tell the story. (~5 min)

4. Make a first draft of all the figures and tables with detailed captions (~ 1 week).  Captions should each be about a paragraph long.  At this point, the figures need not be "camera ready", but should have all the main points made.  

5. Get feedback on figures.  Show the figures to your colleagues who are not co-authors on your paper, do not show them the captions, and ask them to tell you what the main point of each figure is.  If they don't get it right on their first try, interupt them, and ask them to go to the next figure.  Then, spend another week updating the figures, and repeat. 

6. Write a one paragraph summary (will become your **abstract**;  ~30 min)
    1. big opportunity sentence: what is the grandest opportunity that this work is addressing?
    2. specific opportunity: what opportuntity specifically will this manuscript address?
    3. challenge sentence: what is hard about addressing this opportunity?
    4. gap sentence: what is currently missing?
    5. action sentence: what did you do to address the gap, overcome the challenge, and therefore meet the opportunity? it should provide the *key* intuition/insight, the magic that makes this work, where others failed.
    6. resolution sentence: what changes for the reader now that you have met this challenge? 


7. Write a five paragraph **intro** (~1 hr).   This will be structured as follows:
    1. bulleted list of  ~3-5 main factors that create an opportunity for your work, filtering from most general to most specific, and not including anything ancillary (~20 min) 
    2. bulleted list of the ~3-5 main challenges that must be overcome (~20 min)
    3. 1 sentence summary of the **gap**, that is, the key ingredient that is missing (~5 min)
    4. 2-3 sentence summary of what you did (~5 min)
    5. 2-3 sentence summary on how your work changes the world (~5 min)


8. Outline the methods and results: this is a 1 sentence summary of every point  in [methods_paper](https://github.com/neurodata/checklists/blob/master/methods_paper.md) (~20 min)

9. Fill in the details of the methods and results (~ 1 week).

10. outline of discussion (~1 hr), to include (not a summary)
    1. bulleted list of previous related work (~20 min)
    2. bulleted list of potential extensions (~20 min)

11. Fill in details of discussion.

11. get lots of feedback (~1 wk)
12. finalize draft figures (~1 wk)
13. finalize draft text (~1 wk)
14. get lots of feedback (~1 wk)
15. finalize manuscript (~1 wk)


If you follow the above plan, you will have a manuscript ready to submit 2 months after you start writing.
