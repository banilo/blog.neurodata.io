*********************


Upon believing that you have completed work sufficient to write a peer reviewed manuscript, follow the below steps in order. If you are simply writing an abstract (for a conference, for example), just do the section entitled "Outline and Abstract"

Step 0 is to read [how to structure a paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619). I also recommend reading [Writing Science](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-Papers-Proposals-Funded/dp/0199760241).  Once you've read them, follow these steps:


1. **Main Result** 
   
   1. Write a one sentence summary of your work (will become your **title**;  ~5 min). This sentences describes the main take home message / main result.  Avoide jargon to the extent possible, and grab the attention of your readership with strong substantiated claims. It is often required to have  less than 88 characters.
   2. Draw (or make) the "killer fig" that makes the point as clearly and concisely as possible.  Guidance for making paper quality figures is [here](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html).  (~5 min)
   3. Get feedback from your PI and other principle authors.  If the author list is unclear, send this summary and figure to everyone you think might believe they deserve to be authors on the manuscript, and invite them to be co-authors.  Tell them that if they agree (by responding to you and the corresponding author), they can expect to get emails from you with updates, each of which will request feedback.  And if they provide feedback, it will be carefully considered.  Explain to them that the goal of feedback at this particular stage is that you'd like to know what they gathered was the main point of your paper, based on reading the title and looking at the killer fig (without sending them the caption).  If they don't get it exactly right, iterate until they do (don't tell them the answer, just update the title/figure). 


2. **Outline and Abstract** 
   
   1. Describe the other results, typically 3-5 additional figures or theorems.  The goal of each of these is to support the main claim, for example, by further refining, adding controls, etc.  Ideally, they are sequenced together in a logical chain, like a proof, each building on the next, to tell the story. (~1 hr)
   2. Write a one paragraph summary (will become your **abstract**;  ~30 min).  This will be about 250 - 300 words, more than 500 words is a page, not an abstract.  To include:
       1. Big opportunity sentence: what is the grandest opportunity that this work is addressing?
       2. Specific opportunity: what opportuntity specifically will this manuscript address?
       3. Challenge sentence: what is hard about addressing this opportunity?
       4. Gap sentence: what is currently missing?
       5. Action sentence: what did you do to address the gap, overcome the challenge, and therefore meet the opportunity? it should provide the *key* intuition/insight, the magic that makes this work, where others failed.
       6. Resolution sentence: what changes for the reader now that you have met this challenge? 
Note that the above structure is called "OCAR" in [Writing Science](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Science-Papers-Proposals-Funded/dp/0199760241), for *O*pportunity, *C*hallenge, *A*ction, and *R*esolution (tehcnically they use "Opening" instead of "Opportunity", but I like "Opportunity" more).  Steps 1 and 2 form the opportunity, steps 3 and 4 form the challenge, 5 is action and 6 is resolution.  
   3. Ask for feedback from senior and other co-first authors. Explain that the role of feedback at this stage is for them to tell you whether they think there are any glaring  flaws with the basic setup, eg, do they have a different idea about what is the biggest challenge.  There is no need to knit-pick about grammar at this stage. 


1. **Figures** 
   1. Make a first draft of all the figures and tables with detailed captions (~ 1 week).  Captions should each be about a paragraph long.  At this point, the figures need not be "camera ready", but should have all the main points made.  
   2. Get feedback on figures from co-authors and close colleagues (~1 week).  Show them the figures, do not show them the captions, and ask them to tell you what the main point of each figure is.  If they don't get it right, don't worry about it, take notes on what they thought, and ask them to go to the next figure.  Then, spend another week updating the figures, and repeat. 




2. **Outline** 

   1. Make all the figures and captions "camera ready" (~1 week).  Consult this [figure checklist](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html) to confirm that they are indeed camera ready.

    1. Write a "long-form" outline of the **intro** (~1 hr).   This is essentially an expansion of the abstrast, and is therefore structured as follows:
       1. a bulleted list of  ~3-5 main factors that create an opportunity for your work, filtering from most general to most specific, and not including anything ancillary (~20 min) 
       2. bulleted list of the ~3-5 main challenges that must be overcome (~20 min)
       3. 1 sentence summary of the **gap**, that is, the key ingredient that is missing (~5 min)
       4. 2-3 sentence summary of what you did (~5 min)
       5. 2-3 sentence summary on how your work changes the world (~5 min)

    2. Outline the methods and results: this is a 1 sentence summary of every point  in [methods_paper](https://github.com/neurodata/checklists/blob/master/methods_paper.md) (~20 min)

   2. Fill in the details of the methods and results (~ 1 week). Allow for at least one paragraph per figure, table, and/or theorem.

   3. Outline the  discussion (~1 hr), to include (not a summary)
       1. bulleted list of previous related work (~20 min)
       2. bulleted list of potential extensions (~20 min)
   4. Get feedback from your co-authors.  At this stage, the question is whether the logic is sound, meaing, based on the challenge you proposed, the sequence of results provides compelling evidence that you've satisfactorily addressed it. If they disagree, iterate until there is agreement.

2. **Draft** 

1. Expand the outline into a full draft


3. **References** make sure you have sufficiently cited the literature to place your work in context.  For conferences, it is typical to have about 1 page of citations (10-20).  For journal articles, 30-50 is more typical.  Recall, the authors of these papers are likely to be the reviewers and readers for this paper. So, it is important that you highlight all the important work, and say how great it is.

4. **wordsmithing**
   1. **Paragraphs** check that paragraphs follow [paragraph guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/paragraphs.html).
   2. **Words** check that words follow [words guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/words.html).
   3. **shorten** read the paper carefully, and remove any words that are unnecessary. 

5.  **Feedback** Get lots of feedback from >1 person who is in the community of potential readers of your published manuscript.  Ask them to read it as if they are reviewing it for a journal, and to hold nothing back. Ask them to give you comments in one week.  You are not beholden to them, but taking their criticism seriously and making improvements to the manuscript on their basis would be wise. 

6.  **Revision** 

    1.  Update abstract and introduction to final pre-feedback draft on text (~1 day).
    2.  Revise manuscript addressing each and every one of their concerns (~1 week).  This does not necessarily mean making new figures, rather, it might mean clarifying various points of confusion.
    3.  Do another round of feedback, give them another week.


7.  **Submission**
   
Finalize manuscript (~1 wk), submnit to journal, make code open source, make data anonymized and open access, post report to arXiv or biorXiv.


*************************

If you follow the above plan, you will have a manuscript ready to submit 2 months after you start writing.
