**tl;dr** 

1. **main result** write draft paper title and  draft killer fig that visually makes the main point of your story
2. **outline** write title, abstract, and outline based on [how to structure a paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)
3. **figures** make the remaining figures, check that they follow [figure guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html)
4. **draft** flesh out details of paper. 
5. **references**
6. **paragraphs** check that paragraphs follow [paragraph guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/paragraphs.html)
7. **words** check that words follow [words guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/words.html)
8. **feedback** send to co-authors for review & detailed critical feedback
9. **revision** revise 
10. **submission** post to arxiv and submit to journal

*********************


Upon believing that you have completed work sufficient to write a peer reviewed manuscript, follow the below steps in order. If you are simply writing an abstract, just do the section entitled "Outline and Abstract"



1. **Main Result** 
   
   1. Write a one sentence summary of your work (will become your **title**;  ~5 min). This sentences describes the main take home message / main result.  It should not have any words that most of your readership will not be familiar with.  It should be attention grabby, it should have less than 88 characters.
   2. Also, draw/make the "killer fig" that makes the point as clearly and concisely as possible.  Guidance for making paper quality figures is [here](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html).  (~5 min)


2. **Outline and Abstract** 
   
   1. Describe the other results, typically 3-5 additional figures or theorems.  The goal of each of these is to support the main claim, for example, by further refining, adding controls, etc.  Ideally, they are sequenced together in a logical chain, like a proof, each building on the next, to tell the story. (~1 hr)
   2. Write a one paragraph summary (will become your **abstract**;  ~30 min).  This will be about 250 - 300 words, more than 500 words is a page, not an abstract.  To include:
       1. Big opportunity sentence: what is the grandest opportunity that this work is addressing?
       2. Specific opportunity: what opportuntity specifically will this manuscript address?
       3. Challenge sentence: what is hard about addressing this opportunity?
       4. Gap sentence: what is currently missing?
       5. Action sentence: what did you do to address the gap, overcome the challenge, and therefore meet the opportunity? it should provide the *key* intuition/insight, the magic that makes this work, where others failed.
       6. Resolution sentence: what changes for the reader now that you have met this challenge? 




3. **Figures** 
   1. Make a first draft of all the figures and tables with detailed captions (~ 1 week).  Captions should each be about a paragraph long.  At this point, the figures need not be "camera ready", but should have all the main points made.  
    1. Get feedback on figures (~1 week).  Show the figures to your colleagues who are not co-authors on your paper, do not show them the captions, and ask them to tell you what the main point of each figure is.  If they don't get it right on their first try, interrupt them, and ask them to go to the next figure.  Then, spend another week updating the figures, and repeat. 




1. **Draft** 

   1. Make all the figures and captions "camera ready" (~1 week).  Consult this [figure checklist]([here](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html)) to confirm that they are.

    2. Write a five paragraph **intro** (~1 hr).   This will be structured as follows:
       1. bulleted list of  ~3-5 main factors that create an opportunity for your work, filtering from most general to most specific, and not including anything ancillary (~20 min) 
       2. bulleted list of the ~3-5 main challenges that must be overcome (~20 min)
       3. 1 sentence summary of the **gap**, that is, the key ingredient that is missing (~5 min)
       4. 2-3 sentence summary of what you did (~5 min)
       5. 2-3 sentence summary on how your work changes the world (~5 min)

    3. Outline the methods and results: this is a 1 sentence summary of every point  in [methods_paper](https://github.com/neurodata/checklists/blob/master/methods_paper.md) (~20 min)

   2. Fill in the details of the methods and results (~ 1 week).

   3. Write  discussion (~1 hr), to include (not a summary)
       1. bulleted list of previous related work (~20 min)
       2. bulleted list of potential extensions (~20 min)

1. **References** make sure you have sufficiently cited the literature to place your work in context.  For conferences, it is typical to have about 1 page of citations (10-20).  For journal articles, 30-50 is more typical.  Recall, the authors of these papers are likely to be the reviewers and readers for this paper. So, it is important that you highlight all the important work, and say how great it is.

1. **Paragraphs** check that paragraphs follow [paragraph guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/paragraphs.html)

3. **Words** check that words follow [words guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/10/14/words.html)



3.  **Feedback** Get lots of feedback from >1 person who is in the community of potential readers of your published manuscript.  Ask them to read it as if they are reviewing it for a journal, and to hold nothing back. Ask them to give you comments in one week.  You are not beholden to them, but taking their criticism seriously and making improvements to the manuscript on their basis would be wise. 

2.  **Revision** 

    1.  Update abstract and introduction to final pre-feedback draft on text (~1 day).
    2.  Revise manuscript addressing each and every one of their concerns (~1 week).  This does not necessarily mean making new figures, rather, it might mean clarifying various points of confusion.
    3.  Do another round of feedback, give them another week.


3.  **Submission**
   
Finalize manuscript (~1 wk), submnit to journal, make code open source, make data anonymized and open access, post report to arXiv or biorXiv.


*************************

If you follow the above plan, you will have a manuscript ready to submit 2 months after you start writing.
