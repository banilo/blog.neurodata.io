I get many emails from potential trainees inquiring about a job, 
this ranges from high school students to people that have already completed a few postdocs.
I try to respond to every single one, however, if the email does not even mention my name,
it is effectively spam in my book, and I simply delete it.
If the person mentions my name, but otherwise mentions nothing else about our work, 
I typically respond to say that we are not a good fit (which always seems true).
Below is a template of an email that gets me excited to respond, 
mostly probably because it caters to my ego.
Nonetheless, it is effective, and potentially helpful, so I thought I'd share.
I've written it as if this person is finishing grad school, so make appropriate changes if you are finishing something else.

Dear Prof. X, 

I have been studying [something quite relevant to your research] for the last several years, and I expect to graduate in [expected month]. 
During my PhD, I became familiar with your work, specifically, the article "[some article from our group]".  
I am particularly intrigued by this work because of [X], which is one of the things I am most excited about studying next.
I would therefore be thrilled to do a postdoc in your group. 
For your convenience, I have attached my CV (which includes the names contact info for three potential recommenders), 
as well as my unofficial graduate school transcript.

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Best,
[Some Awesome Person.]
